# Introduction
Biomass burning things important for some reason. Magnitude
and direction unclear what they do see Haywood et al (2000).
Measurements by us set out to do something using mass 
spectrometer data (Allan et al 2001).

# Simulations
John's box model is consistent with something that i talked
about above. Growth mechanism, Dominant. Something.

# Methodology
We used something to do something. This was made better by 
not doing it. This was found out previously (Smith et al 2001).

# Experimental field tests
Did some tests in a field, things happened. Results got.

# Results
We report there is in fact gas.

# Figures
This is a figure, that is in fact text.

# Conclusion
The results meant nothing useful. I've decided to drop out and
go to do an art history course.
